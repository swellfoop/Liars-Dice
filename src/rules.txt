Also known as Liar's Dice

A two player game.

Each player secretly rolls a set of dice. In SS, you roll five 4-sided dice each.
Players then take it in turns to bet on how many of each die face is showing, having only their own set to go on.
Betting works as follows:
- You may only make a bet where the quantity or value of the bet has been raised
- The quantity may rise and fall with each value, but the value may only rise
-- ie. You may NOT raise a quan:3 val:4 bet to quan:4 val:1, but you may raise it to quan:1 bet:5
Win condition:
- One player says that they don't believe the other. If the accuser is right then they win the round. If the accuser is wrong then they lose the round.
- This can also be forced when the bet becomes un-raisable ie. quan:10 val:4 for the first round
- The round loser loses one die from their hand
- Once a player is down to zero dice, the opposing player wins
